### Machine learning project

Implementation of an unsupervised machine learning classification algorithm for fraud detection
-Exploration, cleaning and formatting of the dataset
-Use of a correlation metric to determine the dependencies between variables
-Application of LocalOutlierFactor and Isolation forest on datasets and comparison of success rate : Isolation Forest has a better success rate
